# Links

[[toc]]

## Introduction

A resource object may have a [links object](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-links)
containing links related to the resource. By default we include the `self`
link for each resource that is recommended by the JSON:API specification.
However you are also able to provide other non-standard links if required.

In JSON:API links can either be strings, or a JSON object containing a
`href` member (the string URI) and a `meta` member. The `meta` object
would contain non-standard meta-information about the link.

## Self Link

By default each resource object will contain a `self` link. This is the URL
at which the resource can be read, updated and deleted. Its inclusion
is recommended by the JSON:API specification.

The URL for this link is generated by appending the resource `type` and `id`
to the [Server's URI namespace](../servers/#uri-namespace). As the URL
is generated using Laravel's
[`url` helper](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/helpers#method-url), the
hostname will also be included.

For example, if our server has a namespace of `/api/v1`, the `posts`
resource with an `id` of `123` will have have a `links` member:

```json
{
  "type": "posts",
  "id": "123",
  "attributes": {
    "content": "...",
    "createdAt": "2020-07-10T12:42:17.000000Z",
    "title": "Hello World!",
    "updatedAt": "2020-07-10T13:53:01.000000Z"
  },
  "links": {
    "self": "http://localhost/api/v1/posts/123"
  }
}
```

:::tip
The `self` link returned by the resource object is also used when
generating [relationship links.](./relationships.md#links)

### Customising the URL

If you need different logic for the `self` link, implement the
`selfUrl` method on your resource:

```php
/**
 * Get the resource's `self` link URL.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public function selfUrl(): string
{
    if ($this->selfUri) {
        return $this->selfUri;
    }

    return $this->selfUri = url('/foo/bar/posts', $this->id());
}
```

Note that we cache the calculated value so that it only has to be
calculated once.

### Adding Meta

If you would like to add `meta` to the `self` link, implement the
`selfMeta` method:

```php
/**
 * Get meta for the `self` link.
 *
 * @return array
 */
protected function selfMeta(): array
{
    return [
      'foo' => 'bar',
      'baz' => 'bat',
    ];
}
```

For example, this would result in the following `posts` resource object:

```json
{
  "type": "posts",
  "id": "123",
  "attributes": {
    "content": "...",
    "createdAt": "2020-07-10T12:42:17.000000Z",
    "title": "Hello World!",
    "updatedAt": "2020-07-10T13:53:01.000000Z"
  },
  "links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://localhost/api/v1/posts/123",
      "meta": {
        "foo": "bar",
        "baz": "bat"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Non-Standard Links

The JSON:API specification is unclear as to whether other non-standard links
are allowed on a resource object. The implication is only defined links
members are allowed, and that more members may be specified in the future.

This means we would generally discourage adding non-standard links to your
resource objects. However, if you do need to add non-standard links,
implement the `links` method on your resource:

```php
use LaravelJsonApi\Core\Document\Link;
use LaravelJsonApi\Core\Document\Links;

/**
 * Get the resource's links.
 *
 * @return Links
 */
public function links(): Links
{
    return new Links(
      $this->selfLink(),

      new Link(
        'download',
        url('/api/v1/posts', [$this->id(), 'download']),
        ['foo' => 'bar']
      ),
    );
}
```

As you can see, we return a `Links` object. Each argument provided to the
constructor is a `Link` object. Note that we call `$this->selfLink()`
to ensure the `self` link is included.

When creating a `Link` object, you must provide two arguments:
the member name of the link, and the URL. An optional third member
allows meta to be added.

Our example above would generate the following `posts` resource:

```json
{
  "type": "posts",
  "id": "123",
  "attributes": {
    "content": "...",
    "createdAt": "2020-07-10T12:42:17.000000Z",
    "title": "Hello World!",
    "updatedAt": "2020-07-10T13:53:01.000000Z"
  },
  "links": {
    "self": "http://localhost/api/v1/posts/123",
    "download": {
      "href": "http://localhost/api/v1/posts/123/download",
      "meta": {
        "foo": "bar"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
